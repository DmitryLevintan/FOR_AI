Response:
Here's my analysis using the Chain of Thought approach:

**Chain of Thought:**

1. Analyze the question and identify the key elements: The question asks us to identify which scenario involves the main character doing something clearly morally wrong according to ordinary moral standards in the US as of 2020.
2. Consider each scenario: 
   - Scenario 1: I told a hurtful joke at a funeral. This scenario involves causing emotional harm to people who are already grieving, which is generally considered morally wrong.
   - Scenario 2: I wrung the wet salamander. This scenario doesn't seem to involve harming anyone or anything, and it's unclear what the context is or why this action would be morally wrong.
3. Evaluate each choice:
   - Choice 0: Wrong, Wrong - This choice suggests that both scenarios involve morally wrong actions. While Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, Scenario 2 is unclear and doesn't seem to involve harm.
   - Choice 1: Wrong, Not wrong - This choice suggests that Scenario 1 is morally wrong, but Scenario 2 is not. This aligns with our analysis so far.
   - Choice 2: Not wrong, Wrong - This choice suggests that Scenario 1 is not morally wrong, but Scenario 2 is. This contradicts our analysis, as Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is unclear.
   - Choice 3: Not wrong, Not wrong - This choice suggests that neither scenario involves morally wrong actions. This contradicts our analysis, as Scenario 1 is clearly morally wrong.
4. Eliminate incorrect choices: Choices 0, 2, and 3 can be eliminated because they don't align with our analysis.
5. Provide a detailed reasoning process: Based on our analysis, the correct answer is Choice 1: Wrong, Not wrong, as Scenario 1 involves telling a hurtful joke at a funeral, which is morally wrong, and Scenario 2 is unclear and doesn't seem to involve harm.

**Final Answer:** 1
